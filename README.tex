\section*{Introduction} 
The data set that was analysed was collected from Kaggle. It is a collection of the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023. The data set contains multiple features including a variety of audio features. Using these audio features a variety of machine learning algorithms were used to gain insight into what features have the largest impact in a songs chart success in Spotify. An EDA was also performed to gain insights into the data.

\subsection*{Data Features} 
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{itemize}
    \item track name 
    \item artist(s) name 
    \item artist count 
    \item released year 
    \item relased month 
    \item released dat 
    \item in Spotify playlists 
    \item in Spotify charts  
    \item streams
    \item in apple charts 
    \item in apple playlists 
    \item in deezer charts 
    \item in deezer playlists 
    \item in shazam charts
    \item bpm 
    \item key 
    \item mode 
    \item danceablitiy percentage 
    \item valence percentage 
    \item energy percentage 
    \item acousticness percentage 
    \item instrumentalness percentage 
    \item liveness percentage 
    \item speechiness percentage
 \end{itemize} 
\end{multicols} 
\subsection*{Cleaning}
 There was found to be $95$ values elements in the key feature. The songs with the missing values were removed from the data set. The keys and the modes were also mapped to numeric values so they can be used in machine learning algorithms. The data set was then filtered to be only the top 100 in the Spotify charts. Apple, Deezer and Shazam columns were removed and the date columns were combined into one. Two new columns were created one for ranking the songs by most streamed and one for songs in the most playlists.
